* A Finite State Automaton (FSA) is a kind of decider.

* We're making this an abstract class for now (where not all parts are defined)
* because there are many different kinds of finite state automata. So far we've
* only looked at the simplest kind, but we'll be looking at more complex ones for
* the next homework assignment.
